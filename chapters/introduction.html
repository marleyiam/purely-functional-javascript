<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Writing correct and maintainable software is a difficult task, specially
as software gets more and more complex, more and more concurrent, as the
trend suggests they shall. These problems motivate the pursuit of
alternative approaches to programming in order to keep up with the
times, and functional programming has been re-discovered over and over
again over the past years, with subsets of it slowly finding their way
into mainstream programming languages.</p>
<p>In the next chapters we will study the pure functional approach to
programming, from which most of today&#8217;s ideas for managing complexity
comes from. Functional programming comes from the idea that programs are
just mathematical expressions, and can be resolved like any mathematical
expression, by substituting and reducing expressions. This in turn means
that a computation can&#8217;t perform observable effects, such as showing a
message on the screen, or saving some contents to a file in the HDD.</p>
<p>At first, pure functional programming might sound like a fairly useless
approach, since the goal of all programs is to effect the world in some
way, and allow computer users to observe them. In fact, pure functional
programming makes such effects more powerful. By replacing the actual
effects with a description of what should happen they allow the
programmer to abstract over effects in the same way as they would
abstract over any other value. An interpreter then takes care of
applying these descriptions to the world, in a way that the effects can
be observed.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-functional-programming-matters">
<h2>Why Functional Programming Matters?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-functional-programming-matters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One might say that other approaches to programming can also solve the
problem of writing correct and maintainable software. That is
true. There are many approaches to programming that allow one to achieve
such a goal, and functional programming is just another approach.</p>
<p>There are two points where functional programming particularly excels:
reasoning, and abstracting. A pure functional program is just a
mathematical expression, and as such it can be understood by the use of
equational reasoning, just like any other mathematical computation. More
so, functional programming draws from some of the most abstract branches
of mathematics, such as Category Theory, in order to provide tools for
generalising computations as much as possible and increasing code
re-usability, which in turn lessens the amount of concepts that need to
be understood by the programmer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that functional programming&#8217;s influence of
Category Theory and other abstract branches of mathematics is a
double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides powerful tools for the
programmer to manage complexity by working with higher-level concepts,
and the ability of applying such concepts to as many contexts as
possible. On the other hand, it offers little guidance to the
uninitiated, and can be perceived as a higher barrier to entry than a
programming approach that focuses on concrete concepts instead.</p>
<p>Thorough this book, we will see that, while the perceived conceptual
barrier of abstractions might be scary at first, they&#8217;re easier to
understand on the long run, and not that difficult to learn. Besides,
abstractions allow code to be more reusable, such that bigger programs
can be easily composed in terms of smaller ones. This is an important
characteristic for writing maintainable software, as they grow more
complex.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-use-javascript">
<h2>Why use JavaScript?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-use-javascript" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript isn&#8217;t the simplest or most straight-forward language for the
purely functional approach, but it has one point in favour: it is
ubiquitous. It&#8217;s much easier for one to explore the concepts presented
in this book in JavaScript, since it&#8217;s fairly likely that they already
got everything they need.</p>
<p>Besides, pure functional programming is often seen as not-practical, and
fantasy-land of sorts, whereas JavaScript is increasingly seen as a
practical language. One of the goals of this book is to show that pure
functional programming can be not only practical, but also enjoyable,
and powerful. Applying the concepts to JavaScript seems to be a good way
of achieving this.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“But JavaScript isn&#8217;t a functional programming language!”</div></blockquote>
<p>You will often see people saying that language X is or is not
functional. Most of these people actually mean that language X offers or
not facilities to apply the concepts of functional programming in a
straight-forward fashion. Haskell is seen as one of the best languages
for applying this style of programming, but for the concepts presented
in this book, any programming language that allows first-class and
higher-order functions (such as Scheme, Python, Lua, Smalltalk, etc.)
will suffice.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-follow-the-examples-in-this-book">
<h2>How to follow the examples in this book?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-follow-the-examples-in-this-book" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The examples in this book are presented using the JavaScript programming
language. If you&#8217;re following the book in your web-browser, you likely
have everything that you need to for experimenting with the
concepts. Just open the JavaScript console on your browser&#8217;s development
tools and you&#8217;re good to go.</p>
<p>Alternatively you can download <a class="reference external" href="nodejs.org">Node.js</a> and follow along in your
terminal&#8217;s REPL. Or you can follow along in any language supporting
first-class and higher-order functions, if you prefer. But do note that
this will require you to have a comfortable knowledge of both the target
programming language, and JavaScript.</p>
